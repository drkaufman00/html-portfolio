<h1>The BEST Movies According to Derek</h1>
<h2>Top Three Movies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fast Five</h3>
<p>This is the fifth entry in the Fast and Furious franchise. It did Avengers Assemble before the Avengers movie was released. Top notch fun!</p>
<h3>Jurassic Park</h3>
<p>This movie changed how movies were made. Gone are the days (aside from horror movies) that movies are made from adults, now they are made for everyone to maximize profit. Plus, DINOSAURS!!!</p>
<h3>Last of the Mohicans</h3>
<p>Fantastic music, maybe some of the best in any movie. Also the cinematography is nearly unmatched</p>
